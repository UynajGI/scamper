# CMC.rs Percolation Status and Scientific Definitions

> F0 baseline established 2026-09-03. This document describes the current
> `feat/cmc-percolation` reference implementation and freezes vocabulary for the
> staged platform roadmap. It does not make the provisional API stable.

The normative design and phase order are the [platform philosophy](../docs/metaphysics/2026-09-03-percolation-platform-philosophy.md)
and [implementation roadmap](../docs/plans/2026-09-03-percolation-platform-roadmap.md).

## Status vocabulary

- **Supported:** an API with explicit semantics exists, but not every production
  validation gate necessarily passes.
- **Validated:** the family-specific semantic, exact/reference, statistical,
  invalid-domain, reproducibility, and performance gates pass.
- **Experimental:** usable reference behavior exists, but it is not the intended
  production API or has not passed all production gates.
- **Not implemented:** no supported claim; a generic graph routine producing a
  number does not change this status.

## Support matrix

| Family or capability | Status | Current scope or reason |
|---|---|---|
| Read-only undirected topology capability | Experimental | Independently reviewed F1 `GraphView`/`UndirectedGraphView` contracts use dense IDs and static dispatch; `CsrLattice` and validated zero-copy `BorrowedUndirectedCsr` implement them. The API remains provisional until the foundation milestone stabilizes. |
| Directed topology capability sketch | Experimental | Separate outgoing/incoming signatures exist only crate-private with compile fixtures; no directed API is re-exported before D1 fixes arc identity and storage contracts. |
| Static configuration and Bernoulli-law substrate | Experimental | F2 provisional API separates private activity storage from independent site/bond/mixed laws, validates probability domains and topology lengths, and samples allocation-free after preparation. F3 analysis and F4 runtime composition do not exist. |
| Static site, bond, and mixed Bernoulli percolation on arbitrary owned undirected `CsrLattice` | Experimental | PR #4 reference implementation is extensively scientifically validated, but F3-F4 production analysis, reusable workspace, final observables, and stable adapter API do not exist. |
| Heterogeneous occupation probabilities | Not implemented | `ProbabilityField` and direct Bernoulli sampling form an Experimental F2 substrate only. N1 exact non-identically-distributed validation and any network/domain facade are absent, so this is not a supported family claim. |
| Network random failure and degree-conditioned observables | Not implemented | No network facade, probability field, or original-degree profile. |
| Targeted or adaptive attack and robustness curves | Not implemented | No removal process or vector-valued realization output. |
| Directed static reachability, weak/strong components | Not implemented | `CsrLattice` is undirected; directedness is not a mode flag. |
| Layered space-time directed percolation | Not implemented | No causal-layer process or survival/arrival profiles. |
| Bootstrap percolation | Not implemented | No activation-threshold closure process. |
| k-core percolation | Not implemented | No residual-degree peeling process. |
| Achlioptas processes | Not implemented | No candidate-edge process, rule, or process-time output. |
| Invasion percolation | Not implemented | No frozen thresholds or minimum-frontier growth. |
| Continuum/Boolean percolation | Not implemented | Particle geometry and cell lists exist elsewhere, but no continuum percolation adapter or validated overlap analyzer exists. |
| FK/random-cluster q=1 | Not implemented | Ordinary bond Bernoulli exists, but no external bond-configuration/FK contract or q=1 reduction validation exists. |
| FK q=2 Edwards-Sokal/Swendsen-Wang | Not implemented | SW exists, but its sampled FK bonds are not exposed for this analysis. The worm high-temperature even subgraph is not FK. |
| Generic real-q random-cluster model | Not implemented | No Sweeny or Chayes-Machta sampler. |
| Boundary crossing between explicit vertex sets | Experimental | Implemented and validated for the PR #4 reference path; square/chain have defaults, other topologies require explicit sets. |
| Periodic wrapping/winding | Not implemented | No incidence displacement/cocycle or winding analyzer. Crossing is not wrapping. |
| Newman-Ziff parameter scans | Not implemented | No incremental activation curve or binomial reweighting. |

No percolation family is marked **Validated** at F0. The existing static family
has strong validation assets, but the roadmap reserves production-ready status
until F4 and the uniform Definition of Done are complete.

## Scientific definitions

Let one configuration induce tracked connected components
`C = {C_1, ..., C_K}` with sizes `s_i = |C_i|`. In site and mixed percolation,
tracked vertices are occupied sites. In bond percolation every vertex is
tracked, including isolated vertices. An edge connects in site mode when both
endpoints are occupied, in bond mode when the edge is occupied, and in mixed
mode only when the edge and both endpoints are occupied.

### Components and moments

- **Component size:** `s_i` is the number of tracked vertices in component
  `C_i`; edges are never counted as component size.
- **Largest component:** `S_max = max_i s_i`, with `S_max = 0` when `K = 0`.
  The current reference reports only its size, not identity.
- **Giant-component fraction:** `G = S_max / V_norm`. The normalization must be
  named. The platform default is total topology vertices `V_norm = |V|`;
  normalization by active/tracked vertices is a distinct observable. This is
  defined vocabulary, not a current PR #4 output.
- **Raw cluster moment:** `M_k = sum_i s_i^k` over the stated component set,
  with no normalization. PR #4 reports `M_2` as `SecondMoment` and includes the
  largest component.
- **Finite-cluster susceptibility:** choose one largest component per sample,
  breaking equal-size ties by lowest stable component/root ID, and remove it.
  Then `chi_f = (sum_{i != max} s_i^2) / (sum_{i != max} s_i)`. The exclusion
  happens before ensemble averaging. If the denominator is zero, the observable
  is undefined and must be represented explicitly as missing/invalid, not
  silently as zero or NaN in an advertised scalar result. Removing every tied
  largest component or dividing by total `|V|` are different named policies.
  PR #4 does not compute `chi_f` and its aggregate outputs cannot reconstruct it.

### Connectivity events

- **Boundary crossing:** for explicit vertex sets `A` and `B`, crossing is true
  iff one tracked connected component intersects both sets. Sets may overlap;
  an active vertex in `A intersect B` therefore satisfies the event. The event
  is defined by the supplied sets, not inferred geometry. Its ensemble mean is
  the crossing probability.
- **Wrapping/winding:** on a periodic embedded topology, lift each occupied
  path using explicit integer cell displacements. A component wraps when a
  cycle has nonzero accumulated displacement; winding records generators,
  axes, or rank rather than merely boundary-set connectivity. Vertex IDs,
  `BondType`, and periodic adjacency alone do not define winding. PR #4 does
  not implement wrapping.

### Network conditioning

- **Original degree** is degree in the immutable input graph before occupation
  or removal. An observable conditioned on original degree keeps this label for
  the complete realization or attack trajectory.
- **Residual degree** is degree in the currently active induced graph and may
  change during a process. Residual-degree conditioning or adaptive attack is a
  different process and must be named explicitly.
- Empty degree bins require an explicit missing/undefined representation; they
  are not zero-valued observations.

### Samples and lifecycle

A **realization** is one complete draw or process trajectory under a stated law.
An **ensemble sample** is one realization contributed to an estimator. For
static Bernoulli percolation these coincide: one `sweep()` redraws all relevant
occupancies independently and one following `measure()` analyzes that draw.
Samples are i.i.d.; set `thermalization_sweeps = 0`. For attacks, cascades,
growth, or directed space-time processes, all steps of one trajectory remain
one realization and must not be misreported as independent scalar samples.

## PR #4 behavioral baseline

PR [#4](https://github.com/UynajGI/scamper/pull/4) is open against `dev`; the
recorded implementation head is `f6031bf88bea05f61ecbc2eb669268712c65c866`.
It provides `PercolationMode`, public `Vec<bool>` fields in `OccupancyState`,
`cluster_stats(&CsrLattice, ...)`, `UnionFind`, and scheduler-ready
`PercolationMC`. These names, storage choices, constructor/parameter schema,
and observable names are provisional and are not compatibility commitments.

Reference behavior:

- each sweep independently redraws uniform site/bond occupancy;
- `cluster_stats` allocates fresh union-find and boundary scratch on every call;
- physical undirected edges are scanned once, then tracked vertices are scanned;
- site/mixed omit closed sites; bond mode counts every isolated site;
- outputs are `MaxCluster`, raw `SecondMoment`, `NClusters`, `Spanning`, plus
  `Occupied` for pure modes or `OccupiedSites`/`OccupiedBonds` for mixed mode;
- crossing defaults are open square left/right columns and open chain endpoints;
  all other parameter-built topologies require explicit site sets.

Validation assets retained for migration are documented in
[VALIDATION.md](VALIDATION.md): exact full enumeration and hand-derived 1D/2x2
forms, an independent flood-fill reference, mixed-to-pure reductions,
cross-family and random-graph parity, scheduler tests, fixed-seed
reproducibility, 16-seed z-score gates, and ignored square/cubic critical-region
checks.

Current limitations include owned `CsrLattice` coupling, public storage layout,
uniform probabilities only, fresh per-analysis allocations, scalar results,
one crossing query per analysis, no component identity/labels, no giant fraction
or finite-cluster susceptibility, no wrapping, and no directed, process,
continuum, FK, attack, or Newman-Ziff implementation.

## Performance baseline procedure

`percolation_baseline` measures the unmodified PR #4 `resample` plus
`cluster_stats` throughput path. It does not enable, depend on, or link
`allocation-counter`; the allocation instrumentation lives in the separate
`percolation_allocations` target behind the `allocation-probe` feature. Cases
are named with topology, `V`, `E`, `p_site`, and `p_bond`; all modes use
`p_site = 0.5927`, `p_bond = 0.5`. Topologies are an open chain (`V=4096`),
open square (`64x64`), open cubic (`16^3`), seeded sparse Erdos-Renyi-like graph
(`V=4096`, `E=16384`), and seeded degree-proportional preferential-attachment
graph (`V=4096`, four distinct attachments per added vertex). The latter starts
with edge `(0,1)` and attachment pool `[0,1]`; setup asserts both `pool.len() =
2E` and, vertex by vertex, pool multiplicity equals graph degree.

```bash
# Criterion throughput only; allocation-counter is disabled and unlinked.
cargo bench -p cmc-rs --bench percolation_baseline --no-default-features -- --test
cargo bench -p cmc-rs --bench percolation_baseline --no-default-features

# Standalone allocation/storage probe; no Criterion timing occurs here.
cargo bench -p cmc-rs --bench percolation_allocations \
  --features allocation-probe -- --test
```

The standalone probe prints `VEC_BOOL_PROBE`, `PERCOLATION_ALLOC`, and
`TOPOLOGY_VIEW_ALLOC` records. The topology construction/scan probe uses a
separate measurement region from the F0 sample/analyze allocation baseline.
`site_logical_capacity` and `bond_logical_capacity` are the capacities reported
by `Vec<bool>` in logical elements; they are not byte counts by API contract.
`estimated_owned_storage_bytes` sums the owned CSR vector capacities plus
occupancy storage using the byte-per-element behavior measured for this exact
compiler. It excludes struct headers, allocator metadata, boundary query
vectors, RNG state, and analyzer scratch, so it is a documented estimate rather
than RSS or an allocator measurement of the complete case. Its per-vertex and
per-edge columns are two normalizations of the same estimate, not additive.

`allocation-counter` separately measures 128 post-warmup sample+analyze calls
in one thread and reports allocator-observed calls and bytes per sample plus the
peak live allocation count and bytes in the measurement region. There is no CI
performance threshold because allocator and timing measurements are
environment-sensitive.

### Recorded F0 run

Recorded on 2026-09-03 with:

- CPU: Intel Xeon Gold 6148 at 2.40 GHz; Linux 6.8.0-134-generic x86_64.
- Compiler: `rustc 1.98.0 (88d9e12ae 2026-08-18)`, LLVM 22.1.8;
  `cargo 1.98.0 (797e8a9bc 2026-08-05)`.
- Throughput command: `cargo bench -p cmc-rs --bench percolation_baseline
  --no-default-features`.
- Allocation command: `cargo bench -p cmc-rs --bench percolation_allocations
  --features allocation-probe -- --test`.
- Criterion short-baseline configuration: 10 samples, 100 ms warm-up, 250 ms
  measurement per case. Results below are point estimates; timing is not a CI
  gate.

The throughput target's normal dependency tree contained no `allocation-counter`,
and its final executable contained no `allocation_counter` marker. Thus the
following measurements do not include that crate's global allocator wrapper.

| Topology | V | E | Estimated owned storage bytes | Est. bytes/V | Est. bytes/E | Site samples/s | Bond samples/s | Mixed samples/s |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| chain | 4096 | 4095 | 303,079 | 73.994 | 74.012 | 14,790 | 14,823 | 11,653 |
| square | 4096 | 8064 | 565,128 | 137.971 | 70.080 | 9,027 | 7,544 | 7,190 |
| cubic | 4096 | 11,520 | 941,320 | 229.814 | 81.712 | 7,469 | 6,392 | 5,308 |
| sparse ER | 4096 | 16,384 | 1,101,832 | 269.002 | 67.250 | 4,243 | 4,203 | 3,852 |
| preferential attachment | 4096 | 16,374 | 1,101,374 | 268.890 | 67.264 | 6,515 | 5,553 | 4,552 |

## F1 read-only topology capability

The F1 API remains **Experimental and provisional** after independent review.
`GraphView` and
`UndirectedGraphView` expose dense `VertexId`/`EdgeId`, physical edge endpoints,
and incidence iteration through static dispatch. The public iterator contract is
only `Iterator`; current CSR implementations may provide stronger iterator
properties internally without imposing them on future mmap, generated, or
filtered views. `GraphView::vertex_ids()` is a default convenience, not a
performance requirement for every implementation.

IDs are created publicly only by `GraphView::vertex_id` and
`UndirectedGraphView::edge_id`. Their transparent newtypes guarantee a dense
numeric representation but carry no graph provenance. An ID must be used only
with the unchanged validated view that produced it. Cross-graph IDs or IDs kept
across structural mutation violate the caller contract and may panic at
infallible accessors, but cannot cause memory unsafety. This matters for
`CsrLattice`: its existing public fields remain mutable, so construction or an
explicit successful `CsrLattice::validate()` is the precondition for trait use.

`BorrowedUndirectedCsr` borrows offsets, neighbors, physical edge IDs, and AoS
`[[usize; 2]]` physical endpoints without copying. Its constructor accepts the
empty graph (`offsets = [0]`) and validates offsets, ranges, endpoint agreement,
and exactly two correctly oriented incidences per physical edge. Parallel edges
and self-loops are preserved; adjacency ordering is unrestricted.
Offsets/neighbors alone are insufficient because stable physical edge IDs cannot
be inferred for parallel edges or self-loops.

Construction uses temporary validation state of one byte per physical edge and
drops it before returning the zero-payload view. `try_reserve_exact` capacity or
allocation failures return `TopologyError::ValidationCapacity`; allocator
configurations that abort on OOM cannot be promised recoverable.

Directed out/in signatures remain a crate-private compile sketch. They are not
crate-root exports or compatibility commitments; D1 must define stable arc
identity before publishing them.

`topology_view` compares direct owned access, generic owned access, and generic
borrowed access on an open 128x128 square (`V=16,384`, `E=32,512`, `I=65,024`).
Run with:

```bash
cargo bench -p cmc-rs --bench topology_view --no-default-features -- --test
cargo bench -p cmc-rs --bench topology_view --no-default-features
```

Recorded on 2026-09-03 on the same Xeon Gold 6148 and rustc 1.98.0 toolchain as
F0, using 20 samples, 250 ms warm-up, and 1 s measurement per case. These are the
second complete run after the three-path benchmark was added:

| Scan | Direct owned | Generic owned | Owned delta | Generic borrowed | Borrowed delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Physical edges | 24.211 us | 23.472 us | -3.05% | 13.768 us | -43.13% |
| CSR incidences | 58.033 us | 56.896 us | -1.96% | 57.978 us | -0.09% |

The first complete run also stayed below the 5% regression gate: generic owned
was -0.08% for edge scan and +0.32% for incidence scan; generic borrowed was
-42.93% and +0.89%, respectively. Borrowed edge scans benefit from compact AoS
endpoint input compared with the wider `Bond` records; this is a data-layout
effect, not evidence that trait dispatch accelerates work. There is no CI timing
threshold.

The separate allocation probe constructs and validates the borrowed view outside
the scan measurement region, then repeats a generic edge+incidence scan 128
times. For its open 64x64 square (`V=4,096`, `E=8,064`, `I=16,128`), the 64-byte
view header is an x86_64 rustc 1.98 measurement, not a cross-platform guarantee.
Construction performed one 8,064-byte scratch allocation, exactly one byte per
physical edge. The view owns zero payload bytes. The four borrowed input arrays
total 419,848 bytes (`102.502 bytes/V`, `52.064 bytes/E`); each steady-state scan
performed **0 allocations**, allocated **0 bytes**, and had **0 peak live
allocations/bytes**. Run the probe with:

```bash
cargo bench -p cmc-rs --bench percolation_allocations \
  --features allocation-probe -- --test
```

## F2 activity configuration and Bernoulli laws

The provisional F2 API separates generation from storage. `StaticConfiguration`
owns private vertex and physical-edge masks; the mask type and storage accounting
are crate-private and are not returned by any public method. `VertexActivity`
and `EdgeActivity` accept dense `VertexId`/`EdgeId` values under the same
unchanged-view provenance contract as F1: IDs from another graph or after
structural mutation violate the caller contract and may panic, but cannot cause
memory unsafety. The `law` module is private; reviewed law types are selectively
re-exported. The intended crate-root F2 surface comprises `StaticConfiguration`,
`VertexActivity`, `EdgeActivity`, `Probability`, `ProbabilityField`,
`ProbabilityError`, `SamplingError`, `SiteBernoulli`, `BondBernoulli`, and
`MixedBernoulli`.

The internal mask has logical all, none, and dense states while retaining any
dense byte allocation across endpoint transitions. A new pure site law
materializes only its vertex mask and makes edges logically all-active; a new
pure bond law materializes only its edge mask and makes vertices logically
all-active. Mixed sampling materializes both. Every successful sample writes
complete semantics, so switching law types cannot expose stale state.
`StaticConfiguration::resize` changes both domains and clears logical activity
while retaining usable capacity. Sampling checks graph/configuration and all
heterogeneous-field lengths before any mutation or RNG consumption.

`Probability` validates finite `[0, 1]` values once. `ProbabilityField` supports
uniform, borrowed, and owned validated values without per-sample revalidation.
Uniform exact endpoint fields use logical all/none states and consume no RNG for
site, bond, or any mixed endpoint combination. Heterogeneous fields are sampled
through the dense element loop; exact endpoint elements skip RNG individually,
but no O(1) or whole-field no-RNG contract is claimed for heterogeneous data.
Heterogeneous direct sampling is an **Experimental substrate only**: N1 exact
non-identically-distributed production validation, domain facades, and network
claims remain Not implemented.

The F2 statistical gate aggregates activity across every requested seed rather
than taking a maximum over a growing set of per-seed scores. For each of six
separate domains (uniform site, uniform bond, uniform mixed vertex/edge, and
heterogeneous mixed vertex/edge), probabilities `p_i` give exact total moments

```text
mean     = n_seeds * samples_per_seed * sum_i p_i
variance = n_seeds * samples_per_seed * sum_i p_i * (1 - p_i).
```

Uniform fields reduce to the binomial formula; heterogeneous fields use the
exact Poisson-binomial mean and variance. Each aggregate requires `|z| < 4.5`.
For six approximately normal two-sided gates, the resulting family-wise false
alarm probability is about `6 * 2 * Phi(-4.5) = 4.1e-5`. Zero variance requires
an exact success count. There is deliberately no fixed per-seed maximum,
sign-fraction, or dispersion gate whose rejection probability changes with
`SCUTTLE_ZSCORE_SEEDS`. The targeted test passed at 1, 16, 64, and 4096 seeds;
the observed six-gate z ranges were `[-1.450, 0.935]`, `[-0.759, 1.417]`,
`[-0.568, 1.049]`, and `[-1.782, 0.815]`, respectively. The 4096-seed run took
37.00 seconds on the recorded Xeon host.

`percolation_laws` times only `sample` on an open 64x64 square (`V=4,096`,
`E=8,064`); graph, laws, probability fields, configuration, and RNG are prepared
outside Criterion iteration. The short run uses 10 samples, 100 ms warm-up, and
250 ms measurement per case:

```bash
cargo bench -p cmc-rs --bench percolation_laws --no-default-features -- --test
cargo bench -p cmc-rs --bench percolation_laws --no-default-features
cargo bench -p cmc-rs --bench percolation_allocations \
  --features allocation-probe -- --test
```

Recorded 2026-09-03 on the same Xeon Gold 6148 and rustc 1.98.0 toolchain as F0.
The target contains **14 Criterion IDs**: three site, three bond, seven mixed
uniform, and one heterogeneous mixed. Throughput denominators are `V` for site,
`E` for bond, and `V + E = 12,160` for every mixed case.

| Law | `p_vertex` | `p_edge` | Point time | Point throughput |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Site uniform | 0.01 | all | 6.974 us | 587.30 M vertices/s |
| Site uniform | 0.50 | all | 7.053 us | 580.72 M vertices/s |
| Site uniform | 0.99 | all | 7.200 us | 568.87 M vertices/s |
| Bond uniform | all | 0.01 | 13.708 us | 588.27 M edges/s |

| Mixed uniform | 0.01 | 0.01 | 20.643 us | 589.07 M entities/s |
| Mixed uniform | 0.50 | 0.50 | 21.097 us | 576.39 M entities/s |
| Mixed uniform | 0.99 | 0.99 | 20.685 us | 587.86 M entities/s |
| Mixed uniform | 0.01 | 0.50 | 20.917 us | 581.34 M entities/s |
| Mixed uniform | 0.99 | 0.50 | 20.592 us | 590.53 M entities/s |
| Mixed uniform | 0.50 | 0.01 | 20.543 us | 591.94 M entities/s |
| Mixed uniform | 0.50 | 0.99 | 21.084 us | 576.73 M entities/s |
| Mixed heterogeneous | alternating 0.25/0.75 | repeating 0.2/0.6/0.6 | 32.144 us | 378.30 M entities/s |

The allocation probe warms a mixed dense configuration, switches through exact
`p=0/1`, then measures 128 iterations for five laws across five topologies (25
law/topology records). Site uniform, bond uniform, mixed uniform, mixed
heterogeneous, and repeated mixed endpoint switching all reported
**0 allocations/iteration**, **0 allocated bytes/iteration**, and zero peak live
allocations for chain, square, cubic, sparse-ER, and preferential-attachment
cases. An endpoint-switch iteration performs two samples, `(0,1)` then `(1,0)`,
after both dense buffers have been materialized. The logical worst-case dense
payload is `V + E` bytes: 8,191 (chain), 12,160 (square), 15,616 (cubic),
20,480 (sparse ER), and 20,470 (preferential attachment). These figures are the
expected byte payload for the current dense backend, not a measurement of
private `Vec` capacity or a public runtime introspection API. They describe the
worst-case reusable two-mask state; a fresh pure law does not materialize the
irrelevant mask. They exclude struct headers, RNG state, probability-field
storage, topology, and allocator metadata.

F2 passed independent review and its engineering gates, but its public API
remains **Experimental** until the foundation milestone stabilizes. F3
analyzer/workspace and F4 Carlo.rs adapter layers remain absent.

#### `Vec<bool>` storage evidence

On this compiler, the reviewer concern is confirmed: these `Vec<bool>` values
are allocator-observed as byte-backed, despite `capacity()` being expressed in
logical `bool` elements. Each probe performed exactly one allocation:

| Logical len/capacity | Allocator-observed bytes |
|---:|---:|
| 1 | 1 |
| 63 | 63 |
| 64 | 64 |
| 65 | 65 |
| 4096 | 4096 |
| 8064 | 8064 |
| 11,520 | 11,520 |
| 16,384 | 16,384 |

This is empirical behavior of `rustc 1.98.0`, not a promised representation of
`Vec<bool>` across toolchains. The probe remains executable so future baselines
can detect a representation change instead of assuming bit packing or byte
storage from the type name.

For every topology and mode, the post-warmup sample+analyze measurement returned
**7.000 allocations/sample**, **86,016 allocated bytes/sample**, and a peak of
**7 live allocations / 86,016 live bytes** in the serial measurement region.
These are analyzer reference costs, not targets. Both bench targets' `--test`
commands completed successfully; Criterion exercised all 14 F2 law throughput
IDs listed above. Exact raw Criterion intervals remain in `target/criterion/` on
the measurement host.
